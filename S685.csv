628	82.5 - 82.13	SEC. 8.(a)	IN GENERAL.—Not later than January 1, 2025, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Administrator’’) shall seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences under which the National Academy of Sciences shall carry out a study not less frequently than once every 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the fees established under sections 4692 and 4693 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in achieving the following goals:
629	82.14 - 82.15	SEC. 8.(a)(1)	A net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent, based on 2018 levels, by 2030.
630	82.16 - 82.17	SEC. 8.(a)(2)	A net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent, based on 2018 levels, by 2050.
631	82.18 - 82.21	SEC. 8.(b)	REQUIREMENTS.—In executing the agreement under subsection (a), the Administrator shall ensure that, in carrying out a study under that subsection, the National Academy of Sciences—
632	82.22 - 82.22	SEC. 8.(b)(1)	includes an evaluation of—
633	82.23 - 83.2	SEC. 8.(b)(1)(A)	total annual greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, including greenhouse gas emissions not subject to the fees described in that subsection;
634	83.3 - 83.5	SEC. 8.(b)(1)(B)	the historic trends in the total greenhouse gas emissions evaluated under subparagraph (A); and

637	83.14 - 83.21	SEC. 8.(b)(2)(A)	a projection of greenhouse gas emissions reductions that would result if the regulations of the Administrator were to be adjusted to impose stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions than the goals described in that subsection, with a particular focus on greenhouse gas emissions not subject to the fees described in that subsection;
638	83.22 - 83.25	SEC. 8.(b)(2)(B)	the status of greenhouse gas emissions reductions that result from the fees established under sections 4692 and 4693 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

642	84.7 - 84.10	SEC. 8.(b)(2)(D)	an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions reductions that result from the policies of States, units of local government, Tribal communities, and the private sector;
643	84.11 - 84.20	SEC. 8.(b)(2)(E)	a projection of greenhouse gas emissions reductions that would result from the promulgation of additional Federal climate policies, including a clean energy standard, increased fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for motor vehicles, a low-carbon fuel standard, electrification of cars and heavy-duty trucks, and reforestation of not less than 3,000,000 acres of land within the National Forest System; and
644	84.21 - 84.22	SEC. 8.(b)(2)(F)	the status and projections of decarbonization in other major economies; and

648	85.10 - 85.13	SEC. 9.(a)(1)	establish a target for carbon sequestration that can reasonably be achieved through enhancing the ability of public and private land and water to function as natural carbon sinks;
649	85.14 - 85.15	SEC. 9.(a)(2)	develop strategies for meeting that target; and
650	85.16 - 85.18	SEC. 9.(a)(3)	develop strategies to expand protections for coastal ecosystems that sequester carbon and provide resiliency benefits, such as—
